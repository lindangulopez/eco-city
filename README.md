##### The Explore & Collaborate Website Project, is an initiative for the creation & deployment of Climate Action Plans for Cities and Villages.

In the first set of events, from August 2021 to January 2022, we will create a decision science toolkit to enable cities and towns do environmental impact assessment for sustainable urban development within [planetary boundaries](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/), using [biomimicry for innovation](https://biomimicry.org/what-is-biomimicry/) and principles of [building with nature](https://www.edx.org/course/beyond-engineering-building-with-nature).

## The Output will be an Eco-Web-Site Template for Towns and Villages having problems creating a Climate Action Plan.
